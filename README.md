# Terraform Up and Running
### 2nd Edition

This repo is my code for `Terraform Up and Running 2nd Edition`. As I work through this book I will be typing out the code to learn better.

I hope to be able to use terraform in my next engagement and this book will teach me how to use it.

## Running commands

1. `cd` into the chapter directory (ex. `ch2`)
1. Then run `terraform init folder-name` which will initialize TF in the chapter root directory
1. Run each `main.tf` module by running `terraform [command] [folder]`
  * `[ch2]$ terraform plan cluster-server/`
